-- 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor.
SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM actor;


-- 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name," ",last_name)) AS Actor_Name
FROM actor;


-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, 
-- "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id,first_name,last_name
FROM actor
WHERE first_name LIKE "Joe%";


-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE "%gen%";


-- 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT last_name,first_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE "%li%"
ORDER BY last_name;


-- 2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country
FROM country
WHERE country IN ("Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "China");


-- 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, 
-- so create a column in the table actor named description and use the data type BLOB 
-- (Make sure to research the type BLOB, as the difference between it and VARCHAR are significant).
ALTER TABLE actor 
ADD COLUMN description BLOB NOT NULL AFTER last_update;


-- 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the description column.
ALTER TABLE actor 
DROP COLUMN description;


-- 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name;


-- 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, 
-- but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


-- 4c. The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS. Write a query to fix the record.
UPDATE actor 
SET first_name="HARPO" 
WHERE first_name="GROUCHO" AND last_name="WILLIAMS";


-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! 
-- In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO.
UPDATE actor 
SET first_name="GROUCHO" 
WHERE first_name="HARPO" AND last_name="WILLIAMS";


-- 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
-- Hint: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-create-table.html

-- 6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:
SELECT first_name,last_name,address
FROM staff s
JOIN address a
ON s.address_id = a.address_id;


-- 6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.
SELECT CONCAT(s.first_name," ",s.last_name) AS "Staff Member", SUM(p.amount) AS "Total Amount"
FROM staff s

ORDER BY last_name ASC;


-- 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. 
-- As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. 
-- Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE language_id IN 
	(
    SELECT language_id
    FROM language

JOIN inventory i USING(film_id)

-- 8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. 
-- Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.
